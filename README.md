# Game-Set-Scrape

This is a Python web scraper. It parses selected Wikipedia pages for info about every Wimbledon women's tennis Grand Slam tournament since 1877. It gathers the following data: **Tournament Year, Date of Final, Winner's Name**. It then outputs the results to an empty Excel spreadsheet.
